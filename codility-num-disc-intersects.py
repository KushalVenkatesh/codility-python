# 1. NumberOfDiscIntersections
# 
# 
# Task description
# Given an array A of N integers, we draw N discs in a 2D plane such that the I-th disc is centered on (0,I) and has a radius of A[I]. We say that the J-th disc and K-th disc intersect if J â‰  K and J-th and K-th discs have at least one common point.
# Write a function:
# def solution(A)
# that, given an array A describing N discs as explained above, returns the number of pairs of intersecting discs. For example, given N=6 and:
# A[0] = 1  A[1] = 5  A[2] = 2 
# A[3] = 1  A[4] = 4  A[5] = 0  
# intersecting discs appear in eleven pairs of elements:
# 0 and 1,
# 0 and 2,
# 0 and 4,
# 1 and 2,
# 1 and 3,
# 1 and 4,
# 1 and 5,
# 2 and 3,
# 2 and 4,
# 3 and 4,
# 4 and 5.
# so the function should return 11.
# The function should return âˆ’1 if the number of intersecting pairs exceeds 10,000,000.
# Assume that:
# N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [0..2147483647].
# Complexity:
# expected worst-case time complexity is O(N*log(N));
# expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
# Elements of input arrays can be modified.
